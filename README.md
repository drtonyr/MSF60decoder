# MSF-60 decoder

A software decoder for the 60kHz NPL time signal (aka MSF)

The UK radio time signal is broadcast on 60kHz from Anthorn, Cumbria (see [Time From NLP (MSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_from_NPL_(MSF)))

There are many ways to decode this signal, but all seem to involve significant hardware.  This project uses just a bit of wire into a soundcard and does all the hard work in software.
